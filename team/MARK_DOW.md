# Hello my dudes

I'm Mark Dow, a senior Computer Science student at UMass Amherst. I also work for Lockheed Martin doing autonomous flight research.


Some of my favorite things:

1. Trying new food
2. Being outside
3. Feeding Veer everclear 
4. Craft beer


I can also do a backflip, ask me about it
