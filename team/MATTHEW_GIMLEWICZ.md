# About

I am a senior Computer Science (BS) student at UMass. Over this previous summer I interned with Raytheon doing GUI development in Java (yes... GUI development in Java). Outside of CS I have a passion for fitness and nutrition, and tend to read up on modern studies in both fields. My expertise mostly remains in backend development, but I'm looking to further my front-end skills with Javascript/HTML/CSS fundamentals we've learned in this course.
